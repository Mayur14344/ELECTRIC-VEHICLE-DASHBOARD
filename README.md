# Electric Vehicle Dashboard using PowerBI
Interactive EV Dashboard analyzing sales, adoption trends, charging infrastructure, and regional performance to provide insights into the electric vehicle market.

The EV Dashboard is a Power BI project that analyzes electric vehicle adoption, sales, and charging infrastructure. Data was cleaned and modeled in a star schema using Power Query, with DAX measures for KPIs such as growth rates, utilization, and regional penetration. Interactive visuals—charts, maps, and slicers—allow users to filter by year, region, and manufacturer. The dashboard provides stakeholders with actionable insights for market trends and infrastructure planning.
